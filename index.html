                From 10:15 to 10:45 every day, the playground fills with children. The unsung hero of those thirty minutes is the recess monitor: helping kids that need it and calming down kids that get a bit out of hand, the recess monitor keeps the peace. A good recess monitor is the ultimate ally, but on any playground, the kids are allies as well.

            <p>
                Can you help the children play nice for a full 30 minutes? Can you show them what it means to be an ally? Can you last through RECESS?
